<h2>1 - HecksNet</h2>
<h3>2018.01.16</h3>
<p>Greetings and salutations! This is my blog! I will probably sometimes post things here!</p>
<p>I figure, just to get some content up, that I could post a rundown of the services and machines that make up my lab/hecksadecimal.com/HecksNet, as I like to call it because I'm a lame nerd who likes lame nerd names for things.</p>
<p>The hardware situation here is modest, but serves my needs well enough for the time being at least.</p>
<p>To start, hecksadecimal.com and most other services are provided by a dedicated host, Titan, running Proxmox that a friend and I split the bill for. Packing dual Xeon something-or-others for 8 cores and 16 threads at 2.27GHz, 24GB ECC DDR3 RAM, a 240GB SSD for smaller VMs or those that really <i>feel the need for speed,</i> and a single larger 2TB HDD for bigger VMs or those where you don't, in fact, <i>gotta go fast</i> at all times.</p>
<p>I hear some folks in the audience gasping already. <i>But Chris,</i> you ask, <i>that's so little storage!</i></p>
<p>It is for certain workloads, but unless you're storing your entire uncompressed lossless music collection or all your videos on there, you can stretch it surprisingly far. Code and text files are pretty damn small.</p>
<p><i>Buh buh buh but backups!</i></p>
<p>I'll get to that, hold your horses. My methods are unconventional, but they work. For me, anyway. I don't know how my friend handles backups for himself, it's none of my business. Not my VMs, not my deal.</p>
<p>Heretic, the VM that handles this web site, also handles some other services that don't change too much; Gogs (git), Mumble (VOIP), ZNC (IRC bouncer), etc. All pretty lightweight services, runs without a hitch with 4 cores, 2GB RAM, and 50 GB SSD space. Hell, I could pare it down to probably 2 cores and 1GB of RAM if I really needed to, but I don't, so I won't. At least not for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Titan packs more goodies than just a small-scale production VM though. It also handles Heimdall, my OpenVPN server for a few trusted friends and me; as well as Hermodr, my Resilio Sync VM. Both piggyback on Titan's IP using <s>magic</s>NAT to help deal with the only annoyance about Titan's service plan: only 5 public IPs :(. I use Hermodr to help distribute books and other educational media to a programming community I'm an administrator of, and it also handles file sync and backups between my personal machines.</p>
<p><i>R-R-Resilio Sync? F-For backups?</i></p>
<p>Ayuh. I drop a file in the (ever-growing but still reasonably-sized) Sync directory on one of my machines, it beams automagically to the rest of them. Sure, sure, it's not <i>technically</i> a backup solution, but it works, it's free-as-in-beer, and is also flexible enough for my file-sharing needs. I wish it were free-as-in-speech like its competitor SyncThing, but in my experience it's so far ahead of SyncThing that I can overlook its proprietary base. Server/service backups are compressed and dropped in the Sync directory on the regular.</p>
<p>Not hosted on Titan in order to play nice with our limited number of public IPs and because it's just less work altogether, I have a $5/month DigitalOcean droplet handling Mail-in-a-Box, which isn't just email as the name implies, but also calendar and contacts sync. Very helpful in my quest to de-Google/de-Apple/de-Anybody-Else-but-Me-Having-Access-to-my-Data-Goddammit. <sup>Though, do note that for all the wonderful things about MiaB, the $5 D.O. tier is <i>not</i> powerful enough to handle more than one user, so emulate me with care.</sup></p>
<p>My home network (apartment.hecksadecimal.com, logically) is where things get a little more sparse. Here we have the sandbox, which is just a Raspberry Pi 3 mounted to my wall along with a 320GB 7200RPM HDD I yanked from a well-and-truly-dead laptop, connected via a USB3 to SATA adapter I pulled from a well-and-truly-dead portable HDD. A match made in <s>the junkyard</s>Heaven. This handles services that I'm experimenting with or that for whatever reason I don't want going on Heretic just yet, as well as a DuckDNS updater to keep me sane in spite of having a dynamic home IP. It's also a read-only Resilio Sync node for just a little bit of extra data redundancy.</p>
<p>From there we move to my... desktop? Fenrir, an Asus GL552VW laptop that I have on permanent desktop duty, is hooked up to an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse, owing to its abysmal battery, build quality and heavy weight (great machine for the price, but corners had to be cut somewhere). Core i5-6300HQ, 16GB DDR4, GTX 960M, a 128GB SSD for my Linux install, a 1TB WD Red HDD for my Plex media, Linux ISOs, etc. Also another Sync machine. No major complaints here, though I do occasionally find myself wishing I had a bit more space to play with on Titan so I could offload Plex to it, but <i>*shrug.*</i></p>
<p>Honorable mention to my travel machine, Freyja. A beautiful, stickered-out, extended-battery-toting Lenovo X220. Core i5-2520M, 8GB DDR3, 128GB SSD. Also a Sync node.</p>
<p>Plain old <i>mention</i> to my phone, Odin. iPhone SE 64GB. Only mentioning because, yes, it too is a Sync node. I don't take many photos, don't listen to too much music, and don't keep videos on my phone (that's what Plex is for). May as well take up that space with yet more glorious, hacky Sync redundancy.</p>
<p>This concludes our brief tour of HecksNet, please exit through the door to your left, try our delicious apple pie, say hello to the fish, and leave me so I can finish this far-too-long blog post and go to sleep after staying up all night setting everything up all pretty-like.</p>
